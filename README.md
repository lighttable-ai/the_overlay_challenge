# overlay_app

Testing manual and automated overlay methods

You can run the backend with `make install-backend` and then `make run-backend`

The backend input is two grayscale images and a JSON-encoded list of matching points. The output is a JPEG-encoded image of the resulting overlay

You will write the frontend.
